<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle Example</h1>

<p>Prior to this lab, I configured the osTicket helpdesk system as a test to explore its ticket management capabilities. I set up roles, departments, and teams to manage permissions and organise ticket handling. I added agents, end-users, and created SLA plans for response times, as well as categorised help topics to streamline ticket submission. This setup gave me an insight as to how ticketing systems optimise support workflows and help improve organisations in terms of handling incoming tickets.

<p>In this lab, I demonstrate how to manage the ticket lifecycle in osTicket. This example simulates end-user ticket creation, assignment to help desk agents, and resolution, focusing on ticket properties, SLAs, and working tickets to completion.</p>

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Management Steps</h2>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Admin/Analyst Login</strong>: I started by accessing the osTicket Admin Panel and created a help desk agent. For this lab, I simulated ticket creation as an end-user and worked on those tickets as a help desk agent.</p>

</p>


<p><strong>Step 2: Create a Ticket as an End User</strong>: I created a ticket as an end-user reporting that the entire mobile/online banking system was down. Then, as the help desk agent (John), I observed the ticket’s properties, including Priority, Department, SLA, and Assigned To.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Set Ticket Properties</strong>: As the help desk agent (John), I set the ticket properties as follows: SLA - Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7), Help Topic - Report a Problem / Business Critical Outage. Then, as John (a member of the Online Banking Team and SysAdmin), I worked the ticket to completion.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Create Another Ticket</strong>: I created another ticket as an end-user, stating that the accounting department needed an Adobe upgrade. As John, the help desk agent, I observed the ticket properties, set the SLA to Sev-C (8 hours, business hours), and assigned the ticket to the Support department. I then worked the ticket to completion.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Create a Third Ticket</strong>: As an end-user, I created a third ticket reporting that the CFO’s laptop would no longer turn on. As the help desk agent (John), I observed the ticket properties, set the SLA to Sev-C (8 hours, business hours), and assigned the ticket to the Support department. I then worked the ticket to completion.</p>

<p><strong></strong> In this lab, I learned how to create tickets, assign SLAs, departments, and teams, and manage ticket escalations. This practice helps improve workflow and ticket management skills in real-world help desk scenarios.</p>
